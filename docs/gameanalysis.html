        <h1>Game Analysis - Oregon Trail</h1>
        <br>
        <h2> Character Development</h2>
        <p> The main characters are your character(you can only play as the one character) and four
            additional party members. There is not much character development in any of the main
            characters but something I added for additional entertainment was that I named all of
            the party members after some of my real life friends. Other than that you don't learn
            about any characters personality. You only really learn about their health status. This
            led me to feel some level of personal responsability for each party member. The NPC's
            (non playable characters) that you interact with are ones that you trade with or the
            Native Americans who can guide you while you cross rivers.The only time that you talk to
            NPC's are during trades or talking to them to get additional information for the game.
            You can't really be "friends" with any NPC's.</p>
        <h3>Setting</h3>
        <p>The graphics in the game are kept fairly simple and there is only a little music
            incorporated in the game. Music mainly occurs when the game updates you on trail
            conditions and someone dies. The music pieces that play are mainly short pieces. All of
            the music that plays fits the theme of the game by ususlly incorporating instruments
            like a fiddle. As for scenery, the most that you could explore at one time is during
            hunting. The player can scan across the fields to find animals but other than that the
            player is limited in what they can see on the screen at one time. The setup of the game
            looks like this:<br>

             /></p>
        <h4>World of Oregon Trail</h4>
        <p> The world of Oregon Trail is pretty limited. However,the issues that you run into as a
            player are many. For example, parts of your wagon can break which can cost you time to
            get there. An important item that is important to always have are spare wagon parts.
            This will prevent you from getting physically "stuck" in the game. Members on the
            trail(including yourself) can get sick. If the player chooses to rest to help the
            members get better, that will also cost time.Another challenge is that you and/or the
            other members can die. This makes one of your main goals in the game to keep you and
            your members alive throughout the game. Food is also an important aspect in the game. If
            you run out of food your members can get sick or if you have too much food it can
            spoil.Ultimately, the best ways to make progress in the game are to keep a consistent
            amount of food,keep your members healthy and make wise choices when traveling over
            rivers. In doing all three of these, you become more likely to succeed in the game. </p>
        <p> Oregon Trail was primarily created to be an educational game. The game does little to
            acknowledge or make jokes to the player about it being a game. Additionally,since the
            game does not take place in "our" world, it does little to make any social commentary on
            it. The only cultural issue I could possibly find was the game uses the term"Indian" as
            opposed to "Native American" or "Indigenous."One aspect of the game that could possibly
            be providing commentary on cultural issues is not having enough food or lacking
            accessibility to getting certain necesary items occurs from time to time.</p>
        <h5> My Experience</h5>
        <figure>
            <img class="screenshot" src="Oregon%20Trail/OTshop.png"
                alt="a list of items that I bought before the Oregon Trail.The list included 8 oxen,20 sets of clothing,80 boxes of bullets,5 spare wagon wheels,5 spare wagon axels,5 spare wagon tongues and 20 pounds of food."
             /></figure>
        <p> During my first run of the game,I had not done any prior research. I bought many bullets
            without knowing what it they were for. I also only bought 20 pounds because I did not
            know how long the food would last.</p>
        <p> I did not know that you should not ford the river if it was deep. Since I did not really
            know which option to pick,I just decided to risk it and go with the first option.
            Unfortunately,fording the river caused two of my party members to drown. </p>

                alt="a screenshot of when I attempted to forge the river. Two of my members,Kenny and Garrett drowned and I lost 7 oxen,12 sets of clothing,220 bullets,2 wagon wheels,2 wagon axels and two wagon tongues."
             /></figure>
        <p> During my second run of the game, Chase,one of my party members got sick. I did not know
            that I could change the pace we travel which could prevent my party members from being
            sick all the time. </p>
        <figure>
            <img class="screenshot" src="Oregon%20Trail/OT-Chase.png"
                alt="A screenshot that read Chase is suffering from exhaustion." /></figure>
        <p>Overall,I think the game does a great job for what it was intended to be: an educational
            game. I learned about what it was probably like for the people who really traveled the
            trail. However,one aspect that I would change is that I would give the characters more
            personality and increase the variety of potential events that could occur.</p>
