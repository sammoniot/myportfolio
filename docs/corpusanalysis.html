        <h1 class="heading">Introduction</h1>
        <p>For this corpus analysis,I decided to focus on two State of the Union adresses. The first
            one is Andrew Johnson's adress which occured only eight months after the assasination of
            Abraham Lincoln and six months after the trial of Robert E. Lee,who was found guilty of
            treason. There was still tension in the United States and Johnsons adress reflects
            that.Lyndon B. Johnson's adress took place after a little over a year after the Kennedy
            assasination. Although there was still tension from the cold war,LBJ's adress was more
            hopeful. </p>

        <h3 class="heading">Andrew Johnson Findings</h3>
        <p class="text"> Andrew Johnson used the phrase "constitution" 32 times, "government" 58
            times and "united" 44 times.This may have been largely because the country was mainly
            still in shambles. Although the Union wanted to unify the country, many of its citizens
            still wanted many confederates to be executed for treason.Johnson supports its citizens
            while trying to unify them with the confederates again.</p>
        <h4 class="heading">Lyndon B. Johnson Findings</h4>
        <p class="text"> Lyndon B. Johnson's speech used terms like "nations" and "programs" more
            distinctly. He also uses the term "American" more often. He talks about how we should
            prioritize saftey over freedom. His speech also focused on the threats from abroad. </p>
        <h5 class="heading">Comparing the Two</h5>
        <p class="text"> The two presidents both focus on unity in some aspect. Both adresses
            condemning an ideology or group of people who at the time of the speech were considered
            a "threat" to America.</p>
        <h6 class="heading">Contrasting the Two</h6>
        <p class="text"> There were more differences than similarities that I found. The first one
            being that LBJ's speech focused more on threats from abroad,such as communism. Where as
            Andrew Johnson's speech was more focused on the threats of the confederacy and reuniting
            the country. Andrew Johnson used more words overall than LBJ. Andrew used 9,256 words
            while LBJ only used 4,442 words. LBJ's adress also spoke more about American
            exceptionalism and more hopeful policy to benefit the country.The prase "I propose" was
            used nine times by LBJ and not at all by Andrew Johnson. This was most likely because
            LBJ's speech focused more of policy and foreign affairs. Overall,the two speeches had
            more differences than similarities.</p>
