<poemtext>Was a practical man.
He said, <action farming="till">Till the soil</action>
And learn from the land.
<reference speech="Washington">Let down your bucket
Where you are.</reference>
Your fate is here
And not afar.
To help yourself
And your fellow man,
Train your head,
Your heart, <underlined emphasis="your hand">and your hand.</underlined>
For smartness alone's
Surely not meet—
If you haven't at the same time
Got something to eat.
<historicalreference Washington="Institute">Thus at Tuskegee
He built a school
With book-learning there
And the workman's tool.</historicalreference>
He started out
In a simple way—
For yesterday
Was <underlined emphasis="original typed text">not</underlined> today.
Sometimes he had
Compromise in his talk—
For a man must crawl
Before he can walk—
And in Alabama in '85
A joker was lucky
To be alive.
But Booker T.
Was nobody's fool:
<metaphor civilrights="South"> You may carve a dream
With an humble tool.
The tallest tower
Can tumble down
If it be not rooted
In solid ground.</metaphor>
So, being a far-seeing
Practical man,
He said, Train your head,
Your heart, <underlined emphasis="original typed text">and your hand.</underlined>
Your fate is here
And not afar,
<reference speech="Washington">So let down your bucket
Where you are.</reference></poemtext>
