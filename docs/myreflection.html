        <h1>Intro</h1>
        <p>Prior to taking Digit 100 (intro to digital humanities)I had zero coding experience. I
            was also terrible with computers and only really used a few different softwares. I had
            no idea how to organize files or many of the simple commands that most people in my
            major should know. Since taking this course I have learned more about how to organize my
            files and more efficiently use my computer. </p>
        <h2>My Challenges</h2>
        <p>When I first started learning how to code I had many challenges ahead. One of the first
            challenges that I faced was organization. I struggled with finding the documents and
            media that I needed for my site. Once I had folders and shortcuts for my coding I was
            able to more efficiently code because I could find them more easily. Another challenge I
            had was to actually learn about the different coding techniques through w3schools. I had
            to practice many different commands to finally figure out how to style my site. Although
            I faced difficulties,I learned a value skill that I hope to continue to grow in. <a

        <h3>My Goals</h3>
        <p>Although I have progressed more in HTML and have already learned a lot; there are still
            more skills I want to learn. One skill that I want to learn is styling and personalizing
            my code through CSS. I think learning more about it will help me creatively show people
            my work and better understand who I am as a person. </p>
        <h4>HTML V WordPress</h4>
        <p>Although HTML has its challenges, I prefer it over using WordPress. WordPress was much
            easier for me to use personally, in terms of stylizing my site. A problem that I had
            using Wordpress was that the media I imported was not being displayed in the way that I
            wanted it to. When I coded the same media in HTML for my site, it worked in the way that
            I envisioned. I also felt that I could further personalize my site through HTML than
            WordPress. Both of these methods have their own benefits but I would benefit the most
            from using HTML in terms of learning new skills. </p>
        <h5>Beginner's Guide</h5>
        <p>There are at least three very important skills that a coder will need to code. The first
            is to be organized. This is one of the most important skills to have because if you want
            to code with efficiency organization will greatly help you. Knowing exactly where your
            files are will save time and make coding much more convenient. The second is to have
            patience. There are many times,especially when trying something for the first time,that
            the code will not work. It is important to practice to continue to perfect your code.
            The third of many important skills to practice is to be creative. Your code, especially
            for your own site, should be personalized with your preferences of color and other
            stylizations. This will help people learn more about you through your code. When you
            utilize these skills you will be much better equipped to start your code. </p>
